This project focuses on creating a responsive, well-structured web application with proper API integration and TypyScript typing

## API Overview

The MoviesDatabase API (based on TMDb) is a robust and community-powered API that provides metadata for movies, TV shows, actors, directors, and more. It supports:
- Rich metadata access (titles, synopses, genres, cast & crew, release dates, ratings)
- Search and discovery by popularity, date, genre, keywords
- Multilingual content and media (posters, backdrops)
- Trending/upcoming content insights
- Community-driven data and frequent updates
## Version

This documentation targets **version 3** of the TMDb API :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.
